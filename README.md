# SeedBR

The SeedBR Portal brings together an e-learning platform (Seed-VLE platform) and a growing collection of training resources to those who need to know more about Open Source Software and its ecosystem, or need to develop skills, competence and strategies for the teaching-learning of software engineering by means of Open Source Software and related software development practices. 

The Seed-VLE platform is a virtual learning environment to support software engineering education and training with OSS projects. Classes can be created and activities defined base on OSS projects.

Higher education teachers, students and practioners can benefit from the SeedBR Portal.
